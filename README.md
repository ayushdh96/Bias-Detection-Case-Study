# Bias-Detection-Case-Study
This is a bias detection case study in which I took different steps to find and then mitigate the Bias. In the first case study, we just find and prove the bias, but in second, we find bias and then mitigate it. It's very detailed and everything is added in the repository.
The repository contains a code file and the report as well.
This is Purdue University HW2 document and shows the approach I took to mitigate the bias.
